Hello Coding Ninjas this is my submission for the task given.

I have never in my life spent so much time coding.  i spent majority of my day on saturday and sunday trying to do the flipkart scrapper code.

Finally i managed to write something for the flipkart scrapper code after referring to some sources and asking doubts to my dad and even my friends.

Also i thank you for this oppurtunity. I learnt way too much about whole lot of things about coding in general, and its all because i was given this task.

Even if i dont get selected im very content and if i do get selected I am willing to learn a whole lot of things.

Thank you
