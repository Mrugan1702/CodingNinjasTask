Hello Coding Ninjas this is my submission for the task given.

Small Note in the Flipkrt program the link of flipkart reviews page for page number 1 does not contain "&page=" therefore to run the program correctly and store all reveiews in output.csv file the user needs to input the link of the second page of the reveiews page on flipkart for any product .

My Experience:

I have never in my life spent so much time coding.  i spent majority of my day on saturday and sunday trying to do the flipkart scrapper code.

Finally i managed to write something for the flipkart scrapper code after referring to some sources and asking doubts to my father and friends.

Also i thank you for this oppurtunity. I learnt way too much about whole lot of things about coding in general, and its all because i was given this task.

Even if i dont get selected im very content and if i do get selected I am willing to learn a whole lot of things.

Thank you
